# Mushroom Classification Using A Decision Tree
## Feel free to explore the Jupyter notebook to view the data visualizations. I've saved the notebook with the graphs after running the code!

Mushroom Classification Using Decision Trees
This machine learning project aims to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on their characteristics. 
The dataset used contains descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family. 
Each species is identified as either definitely edible or definitely poisonous.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 8124 observations with 21 features and a target class. We will use 80% to train a model and 20% to validate our model.
We will use chi pruning and depth pruning to avoid overfitting.

Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. The following libraries are required:
* numpy
* pandas
* Matplotlib

You can install them using pip commands.
